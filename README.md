Hello Maya users!

You open Maya and always presented with the new blank scene. It's repetitive, you see it a lot.

Next... You’re working on a new scene or shot, and all you want is a simple background, maybe a couple of lights and definitely a camera. But you have to create and set them up from scratch every time, again and again and again! It's frustrating. That’s how I felt… So I created a new tool to make things quicker.

Scene Builder: A go-to tool for fast scene and shot setup. Choose from six customisable backdrops or use an image plane. Drop in a three-point lighting rig or a flexible camera rig—everything you need to get started, fast.

Scene Builder comes in two variations:

Plus - all features
6 backdrops, Image plane, 4 Materials, Material settings, Faded edges, 3 Point light rig, Light rig presets, Light rig settings, Camera rig, Camera settings, Depth of field control, Render presets, Render Settings, Global Scale/Rotate.

Lite - a simpler free version (because not everyone has the same opportunities right now)
1 backdrop, Image plane, 1 Material, 3 Point light rig, Camera rig, Global Scale/Rotate

Scene Builder Plus available on Gumroad:

I hope you find it as useful as I do.
Cheers
James
